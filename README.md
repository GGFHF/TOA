# TOA (Tree-oriented annotation)

TOA aims to establish workflows geared towards woody plant species that automate the extraction of
information from genomic databases and the annotation of sequences. TOA uses the following databases:
Dicots PLAZA 4.0, Monocots PLAZA 4.0, Gymno PLAZA 1.0, NCBI RefSeq Plant and NCBI Nucleotide Database (NT)
and NCBI Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database (NR). Although TOA was primarily designed to work with
woody plant species, it can also be used in the analysis of experiments on any type of plant organism.
Additionally, NCBI Gene, InterPro and Gene Ontology databases are also used to complete the information.

TOA has a user-friendly front-end where researchers can perform the following tasks simply with a few clicks:
i) download biochemical and biological data from genomic databases; ii) design the annotation pipeline that
implements the most appropriate workflow for the experiment they are analyzing; iii) view statistics and
graphics of results;  and iv) track the status of processes during execution.
